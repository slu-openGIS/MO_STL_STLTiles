### Abstract
These data are based on the [East-West Gatewayâ€™s](http://www.ewgateway.org) orthoimagery tiles and their ESRI shapefile that provides an index of these tiles. Their shapefile covers the entire [2015 Aerial Imagery survey](http://www.ewgateway.org/pdffiles/maplibrary/aerialphotos/FactSheet-HowToGetOrthoPhotos.pdf). These data have been clipped so that they only identify orthoimagery that covers areas within the City of St. Louis. The data are available in both the ESRI shapefile format (see `/Shapefile`) or the geoJSON format (see `/geoJSON`). The geoJSON data can be previewed natively within GitHub.
